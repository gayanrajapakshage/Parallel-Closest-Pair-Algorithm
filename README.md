# Parallel Closest Pair Algorithm
 
## Overview

This project implements a multi-process parallel solution for the Closest Pair of Points problem using a divide-and-conquer algorithm. By leveraging UNIX system calls for process management and inter-process communication via pipes, the solver efficiently computes the minimal distance between points in large datasets, reducing computation time compared to traditional serial approaches.
